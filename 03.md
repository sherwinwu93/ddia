# Chapter3 Storage and Retrieval
store and get data
SQL and NoSQL

Having a rough idea about storage engine is good for you to choose storage engines.
Transaction Processing VS Analytics
Column-Oriented Storage
Log-structured (NoSQL?) vs page-oriented(SQL B-trees)

## Data Structures That Power Your Database

Trade-off in storage system: indexes speed up reads and slow down writes

### Hash Indexes
Hash Index: key-value, building block for complex indexes

### SSTables and LSM-Trees

### B-Trees

### Comparing B-Trees and LSM-Trees

### Other Indexing Structures

#### Storing values within the index

#### Multi-column indexes

#### Full-text search and fuzzy indexes

#### Keeping everything in memory

## Transaction Processing or Analytics?

## Column-Oriented Storage

## Summary
how databases handle storage and retrieval

OLTP: optimized for transaction processing
    end users use key, then engine uses indeces to find data
    bottleneck: Disk seek time 
OLAP: optimized for analytics
    Data warehouses(数仓)
    bottleneck: Disk bandwidth

two main school for OLTP:
- log-structured school: only create and delete, no writing
    turn random-access writes into sequential
- update-in-place school: CUD, B-trees example
 
indexing structures, and databases that keep all data in memory

OLTP: when scanning across many rows, encoding data compactly are more important than indexes.
column-oriented storage achieved this goal.

As a developer, the knowledge about internals of storage engines help you find tool better suited.
